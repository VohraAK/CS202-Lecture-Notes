<h1 style="text-align:center;">Introduction To Data Structures</h1>

---

Data structures represent a systematic way to store and organize data in a computer system.


## Key Design Considerations in Data Handling

1. Time: how long does an algorithm take to complete a task?
2. Space: How much space is taken up by the data structure?

## Why Does Time Efficiency Matter?

In large applications of data organisations, especially in large datasets or large applications, time efficiency is crucial, as every second wasted shaves lots from the bottom line.

## Ethics and Data Structure Design Considerations

- Designing a data structure may reveal implicit assumptions about the world and the end users.
- Implementations of data structures may be sensitive to the end users.
